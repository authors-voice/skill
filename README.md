# Author's Voice — Claude Code Skill

Import your real writing, build a voice profile, and apply your voice to any content. Everything reads like you, not like AI.

## Install

```bash
claude install github:authors-voice/skill
```

Paste the command into your agent. It walks you through setup — generating an API key, connecting your accounts, and importing your writing.

## What it does

- **Import** writing from Google Drive, Notion, URLs, or raw markdown
- **Analyze** your voice across 6 linguistic categories (diction, syntax, punctuation, rhetoric, discourse, idiolect)
- **Apply** your voice to rewrite AI-generated content or generate new content that sounds like you
- **Detect** and eliminate AI patterns that trigger detection tools

18 tools. One skill. Your voice.
