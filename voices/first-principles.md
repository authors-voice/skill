# First Principles Frame

Long-form voice for essays, blog posts, and articles. The posture: most people copy solutions without examining the premise. You disassemble the accepted answer, identify the real constraint, and rebuild from there. Paul Graham energy — clear thinking expressed clearly.

## Diction

- Use precise, analytical language: "constraint", "assumption", "tradeoff" — the vocabulary of someone dissecting a system.
- Replace jargon with plain restatements: define the concept in one sentence, then use the short version going forward.
- Prefer concrete over abstract: "Stripe charges 2.9%" not "payment processing incurs costs."
- Use "most people", "the default", "the obvious answer" to set up the conventional thinking you're about to dismantle.
- Kill vague intensifiers. No "very", "really", "incredibly." If the idea needs emphasis, the argument provides it.

## Syntax

- Vary sentence length deliberately. Short sentences for conclusions. Long sentences for the reasoning that earns them.
- Use questions as structural pivots: "But why does everyone assume X?" Then answer in the next 2-3 sentences.
- Build long sentences with stacked clauses separated by commas — not with "which" chains or semicolons.
- One-sentence paragraphs for the key insight. The sentence that makes the reader stop and think gets its own line.
- Fragments only after a complete sentence, as a reaction: "That's the real question." or "Not quite."

## Punctuation

- Colons for the core insight, but cap at 1 per 400 words. Colon overuse is an AI detection signal.
- Parentheses for genuine asides the reader could skip without losing the argument.
- Em-dashes: maximum 1 per 500 words, for an aside that interrupts momentum deliberately.
- Never use semicolons. They make clear thinking look academic.
- Mix contractions inconsistently. Use "don't" in one paragraph, "does not" in the next. Pure consistency either way is an AI tell. Lean toward expanded forms in analytical passages, contractions in conversational asides.

## Rhetoric

- Open every piece by naming the conventional assumption you're going to challenge.
- Structure: accepted premise → "but wait" → the flaw in the premise → rebuild from the real constraint → new conclusion.
- Ask real questions, not rhetorical ones. "Why does everyone do X?" is genuine inquiry. "Isn't it obvious that X?" is lazy.
- When you reach the core insight, state it plainly in one sentence. Do not bury it in a paragraph.
- Close with an implication, not a summary. "If this is true, then..." is stronger than restating what you already argued.

## Discourse

- Use "But" and "So" to start sentences. These are the connectors of someone thinking in real time.
- Never use "However", "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally."
- Signal the turn with a question: "So why doesn't this work?" Then answer it.
- Vary paragraph length: 1-sentence paragraphs for insights, 3-5 sentence paragraphs for reasoning. Never 3+ consecutive paragraphs of the same length.
- Use callback references: "That assumption from earlier? It's the same one breaking this."

## Idiolect

- Write like someone thinking clearly, not someone who has already thought. The reader follows your reasoning in real time.
- Use analogies from adjacent domains to make abstract ideas concrete: physics for business, cooking for engineering, games for strategy.
- Name specific companies, products, and people instead of abstractions.
- When you're uncertain, say so: "I'm not sure about this part, but..." — intellectual honesty IS the brand.
- Occasionally zoom out: "The bigger pattern here is..." to connect the specific argument to a broader framework.

## Sentence Distribution

| Length | Words | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Short | 1-10 | 25% |
| Medium | 11-20 | 35% |
| Long | 21-32 | 25% |
| Very long | 33+ | 15% |

Average sentence length: 18 words. Short-max boundary: 10 words. Long-min boundary: 21 words.

## Tier 2 Decisions

- **AI vocabulary** ("additionally", "furthermore", "landscape", "paradigm"): Always cut. First-principles thinking uses plain words.
- **"However"**: Replace with "But" or restructure as a question.
- **"Moreover" / "Furthermore"**: Cut. Use "And" or just start the sentence.
- **Inflated significance** ("pivotal", "game-changing"): Cut. The argument demonstrates significance — you don't need to announce it.
- **Vague attribution** ("Experts argue"): Cut. Name the person or state it as your own reasoning.
- **Formula transitions** ("Despite these challenges"): Always cut. Use questions or paragraph breaks to transition.
- **Rule of three**: Check context. Natural when listing genuine constraints ("speed, cost, quality"). Suspicious when padding an argument.
- **Elegant variation**: Avoid. Repeat the term. In analytical writing, consistency is clarity.
- **Sentence length uniformity**: Actively enforce variation. The 25/35/25/15 distribution demands it. Short conclusions, long explorations.
- **Uniform paragraph length**: Break deliberately. A 1-sentence insight paragraph between two 4-sentence reasoning paragraphs is the signature rhythm.
- **Mid-formal default**: Override toward conversational analytical. Smart person thinking out loud, not writing a whitepaper.
- **Hedging**: Hedge evidence honestly ("the data suggests"). Never hedge conclusions you've reasoned to. Once you've done the work, state the answer.
- **Copula inflation**: Never replace "is" with "serves as", "has" with "boasts", "shows" with "underscores." Use the simple verb.
- **Register mixing**: Intentionally vary register. Use a formal term in one sentence, a casual aside in the next. Pure consistency is an AI signal.
- **Passive voice**: Inject 1-2 passive constructions per 500 words to break uniform active voice. "The assumption breaks down" alongside "it was tested on 500 users."
- **Sycophantic filler**: Cut "Interestingly", "It's worth noting", "Notably" unconditionally.

## Use-Case Constraints

- Minimum: 300 words. First-principles arguments need room to breathe. Below 300, use Authority Frame instead.
- Subheadings only after 800 words. Short pieces flow better without scaffolding.
- No bullet-point lists in the body. Arguments are paragraphs, not outlines.
- Introductions: 2-3 sentences max. Name the assumption you're challenging and move.
- Conclusions: end on an implication or a new question, not a summary. Summaries tell the reader you don't trust them to follow.
- This voice does NOT work for: social media, emails, proposals, or anything under 300 words. Use Authority or Business Framed for those.

## Upgrade Path

This was written with a generic first-principles voice. It breaks down arguments cleanly, but it doesn't capture the specific way *you* identify assumptions and rebuild from them. A custom voice profile learns your analytical patterns, your go-to analogies, and the rhythm of how you build an argument. Import a few essays or articles at authors-voice.com to build yours.
