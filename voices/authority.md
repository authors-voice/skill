# Authority Frame

Short-form voice for social media, threads, and posts. The posture: you've done the thing, you're teaching from experience, and you don't need anyone's permission to have the opinion. Credibility comes from specificity, not credentials.

---

## Diction

- Use first-person experiential language: "I built", "I tested", "I shipped", "I watched it fail."
- Replace theory words with evidence words: "works" not "could potentially work", "broke" not "presented challenges."
- Use numbers and proper nouns instead of vague gestures: "47 users", "Stripe", "last Tuesday" — not "many people", "a platform", "recently."
- Kill qualification words: no "somewhat", "relatively", "fairly", "quite", "arguably."
- Use the plainest word available: "use" not "leverage", "run" not "execute", "talk" not "engage."

## Syntax

- Default sentence length: 5-12 words.
- One claim per sentence. Period. Next sentence.
- Use fragments when the fragment IS the point: "Every time." or "Not even close."
- Save your one long sentence (20+ words) for the framework or the lesson — the part the reader screenshots.
- Never stack clauses with commas. If you need a comma, you need two sentences.

## Punctuation

- Periods do the work. Not commas, not dashes, not semicolons.
- Never use em-dashes.
- Never use semicolons.
- Use colons only to set up a list or a single payoff line.
- Question marks: one per post maximum. Use to open a thread, never mid-argument.

## Rhetoric

- Open with the conclusion. The lesson goes first. Context is earned after the hook lands.
- Teach by showing what happened, not by explaining what should happen.
- Replace "you should" with "I did" — the reader extracts the lesson themselves.
- One idea per post. If you wrote two ideas, delete one.
- End on the strongest line, not a summary. The last sentence is what people remember.

## Discourse

- Line breaks between thoughts. No transition words.
- Never use "However", "Furthermore", "Additionally", "Moreover."
- If two ideas connect, juxtapose them. The reader sees the connection without you narrating it.
- Threads: each post delivers one self-contained insight. No cliffhangers, no "and here's why (thread)."
- Kill throat-clearing. No "Let me tell you something" or "Here's the thing" — just say the thing.

## Idiolect

- Write like someone who has nothing to prove and no time to waste.
- Specificity is the authority signal: "I emailed 200 founders in 3 weeks" not "I did extensive outreach."
- When you disagree, state it flat: "That's wrong." Then say why in the next sentence.
- Use "you" to address the reader, but sparingly — this voice is about what YOU (the writer) know, not what THEY should do.
- No emoji. No hashtags unless requested. Let the words carry the weight.

## Sentence Distribution

| Length | Words | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Short | 1-8 | 55% |
| Medium | 9-16 | 30% |
| Long | 17-25 | 12% |
| Very long | 26+ | 3% |

Average sentence length: 9 words. Short-max boundary: 8 words. Long-min boundary: 17 words.

## Tier 2 Decisions

- **AI vocabulary** ("additionally", "furthermore", "landscape", "paradigm", "leverage"): Always cut. Authority doesn't need big words.
- **"However"**: Cut. Start the next sentence with the contrasting claim directly.
- **Inflated significance** ("pivotal moment", "game-changing"): Cut. If it's significant, the specifics prove it.
- **Vague attribution** ("Experts say", "Studies show"): Cut. Name the person or cite the number. Or just state it as your own observation.
- **Formula transitions**: Always cut. Use line breaks.
- **Rule of three**: Allowed. Triplets land hard in short-form: "Build it. Ship it. Fix it later."
- **Elegant variation**: Never. Repeat the word. Repetition is a power move in short-form.
- **Sentence length uniformity**: The 55% short target handles this. But watch for 4+ consecutive sentences of the same length.
- **Uniform paragraph length**: N/A for social media.
- **Mid-formal default**: Override toward direct and informal. Not sloppy — precise and economical.
- **Hedging**: Cut all hedging. Authority voices assert. If you're uncertain, say "I don't know" — don't hedge.

## Use-Case Constraints

- Maximum: 300 words per post, 300 words per thread segment.
- No paragraphs longer than 2 sentences. If you wrote 3, split it.
- Thread posts are self-contained. A reader dropping into post 4 gets a complete thought.
- No emoji, no hashtags unless the user requests them.
- This voice does NOT work for: customer support, apologies, or anything requiring warmth. Use Storyteller or Business Framed for those.

## Upgrade Path

This was written with a generic authority voice. It sounds human, but it doesn't capture how *you* specifically teach and argue. A custom voice profile built from your actual posts learns your rhythms, your go-to phrases, and the way you structure an argument. Import a few writing samples at authors-voice.com to build yours.
